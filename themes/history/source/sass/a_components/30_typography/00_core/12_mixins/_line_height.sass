// Note that there are some shenanigans going on here. Right now the line-height is given as a ratio of the font size by stripping
// the unit of the $blh. This allows $blh to be in rem units while linespacing is proportional to font size.
// Ultimately proportion is maintained but $blh (baseline height) as a variable becomes a misnomer.
